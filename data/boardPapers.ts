          solution: '(a) Since ΔABC ~ ΔPQR, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal. AB/PQ = BC/QR = AC/PR. We have AC=8 and PR=6, so the ratio is 8/6 = 4/3. 6/PQ = 4/3 => PQ = 18/4 = 4.5 cm. 4/QR = 4/3 => QR = 3 cm.

This can be rearranged to QS/QR = PQ/QT. In ΔPQS and ΔTQR, we have this ratio of sides and the included angle ∠PQS = ∠TQR (which is common ∠Q or ∠1).

          solution: '(a) In ΔOAC, OA = OC (radii), so ∠OAC = ∠OCA. Since OC is the radius and BCD is the tangent at C, OC ⊥ BCD. Thus, ∠OCD = 90°. ∠OCA + ∠ACD = 90°. Since ∠OAC = ∠OCA, we can substitute to get ∠OAC + ∠ACD = 90°. As ∠OAC is the same as ∠BAC, we have ∠BAC + ∠ACD = 90°.\nOR\n(b) Let ABCD be the quadrilateral touching the circle at P, Q, R, S. Join the vertices to the centre O. In ΔOAP and ΔOAS, AP=AS (tangents from A), OP=OS (radii), OA=OA (common). So ΔOAP ≅ ΔOAS (SSS). Thus ∠1=∠2. Similarly, ∠3=∠4, ∠5=∠6, ∠7=∠8. The sum of all angles at the centre is 360°. 2(∠1+∠4+∠5+∠8) = 360°. (∠1+∠8) + (∠4+∠5) = 180°. This is ∠AOD + ∠BOC = 180°. Similarly, ∠AOB + ∠COD = 180°.' },

How much money did he invest in each scheme?', solution: 'Let amount in A be x and in B be y. Case 1: 0.08x + 0.09y = 1860 => 8x + 9y = 186000 (Eq 1). Case 2: 0.09x + 0.08y = 1860 + 20 = 1880 => 9x + 8y = 188000 (Eq 2). Adding (1) and (2): 17x + 17y = 374000 => x+y = 22000. Subtracting (1) from (2): x - y = 2000.

Therefore, ΔADF ~ ΔEBF (AAA similarity). The ratio of corresponding sides is equal: DF/FB = FA/EF. Cross-multiplying gives DF × EF = FB × FA.\nOR\n(b) In ΔADB and ΔCDA, given AD²=BD×DC => AD/DC = BD/AD. Also, ∠ADB = ∠CDA = 90°. By SAS similarity, ΔADB ~ ΔCDA. So, corresponding angles are equal: ∠BAD = ∠C and ∠B = ∠CAD. In ΔABC, ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°. ∠A = ∠BAC = ∠BAD + ∠CAD. So, (∠BAD + ∠CAD) + ∠B + ∠C = 180°. Substituting from similarity: (∠C + ∠B) + ∠B + ∠C = 180° => 2(∠B+∠C) = 180° => ∠B+∠C = 90°. Since ∠BAC + ∠B + ∠C = 180°, we have ∠BAC + 90° = 180°, which implies ∠BAC = 90°.' },

(c) Why do soaps not work effectively in hard water?', solution: '(a) Differences between Soaps and Detergents:\n1. Soaps are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic acids. Detergents are ammonium or sulphonate salts of long-chain carboxylic acids.\n2. Soaps are not effective in hard water. Detergents are effective in both hard and soft water.\n3. Soaps are biodegradable. Some detergents are non-biodegradable.\n\n(b) Cleansing Action of Soap:\nA soap molecule has two parts: a long hydrocarbon tail that is hydrophobic (water-repelling) and a short ionic head that is hydrophilic (water-attracting). When soap is dissolved in water, the molecules form clusters called micelles. In a micelle, the hydrophobic tails are directed towards the center, and the hydrophilic heads are on the outside. The oily dirt is collected in the center of the micelle. When water is agitated, the micelles containing the dirt are washed away.\n[DIAGRAM: A simple diagram showing a micelle with hydrophobic tails pointing inwards trapping a grease particle, and hydrophilic heads pointing outwards towards water.]\n\n(c) Soaps in Hard Water: Hard water contains calcium (Ca²⁺) and magnesium (Mg²⁺) ions. Soaps react with these ions to form an insoluble precipitate called scum. This scum sticks to the clothes and prevents the cleansing action of the soap.' },

(2)', solution: '(a) Dendrites receive nerve impulses from other neurons.\n(b) Information is acquired at the tip of the dendrite.\n(c) At the synapse, the electrical impulse is converted into a chemical signal (neurotransmitter). This chemical diffuses across the gap and triggers a new electrical impulse in the next neuron. This is how the signal is transmitted from one neuron to another.' },
