const getMath10Solutions = (year: number): string[] => [`
1.  **Solution:** (a) 3024. We know that HCF(a, b) × LCM(a, b) = a × b. So, 6 × LCM = 336 × 54. LCM = (336 × 54) / 6 = 3024.
2.  **Solution:** (b) both negative. For a quadratic polynomial ax² + bx + c, the sum of zeroes is -b/a and the product is c/a. Here, sum = -99 and product = 127. Since sum is negative and product is positive, both zeroes must be negative.
3.  **Solution:** (a) 2. For no solution, a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ ≠ c₁/c₂. Here, 3/6 = 1/k, which gives k = 2. Also, 1/2 ≠ 3/8.
4.  **Solution:** (a) 2√(a²+b²). Using distance formula, d = √((-a-a)² + (-b-b)²) = √((-2a)² + (-2b)²) = √(4a² + 4b²) = √4(a²+b²) = 2√(a²+b²).
5.  **Solution:** (b) 1. sin A cos C + cos A sin C = sin(A+C). In ΔABC, A+B+C = 180° and B=90°, so A+C = 90°. Therefore, sin(A+C) = sin(90°) = 1.
