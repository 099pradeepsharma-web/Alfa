      explanation: "Your brain is undergoing a massive rewiring, like upgrading a computer's operating system. It's a normal, healthy process that makes you smarter and more capable.\n\nKey Areas of Development:\n- <u>The Limbic System (The Emotional Center):</u> This part matures early. It's responsible for emotions, rewards, and social connection. During teen years, it's highly active, which is why friendships feel so important and emotions can feel so intense.\n- <u>The Prefrontal Cortex (The 'CEO' or Reasoning Center):</u> This part, right behind your forehead, is responsible for planning, decision-making, and controlling impulses. It's the last part to fully mature, often in your early 20s.\n\nThe Developmental 'Mismatch':\nFor a while, your super-charged emotional center is more developed than your reasoning center. Think of it as having the powerful engine of a sports car (emotions) but still learning to use the steering wheel and brakes (reasoning). This 'mismatch' is why you might:\n- Act on impulse sometimes.\n- Feel emotions very strongly (both good and bad).\n- Find it harder to see long-term consequences.\n\nThis is NOT a weakness; it's a temporary phase of incredible growth! Understanding this science is the first step to navigating it.",

            title: "The Laws of Reflection",
            explanation: "Reflection is when light bounces off a surface, like a mirror. It follows two simple but powerful rules that govern everything from how we see ourselves to how telescopes work.\n\nKey Terminology:\n- <u>Incident Ray:</u> The ray of light that strikes the surface.\n- <u>Reflected Ray:</u> The ray of light that bounces off the surface.\n- <u>Normal:</u> An imaginary line drawn perpendicular (at 90Â°) to the surface at the point of incidence.\n- <u>Angle of Incidence (âˆ i):</u> The angle between the incident ray and the normal.\n- <u>Angle of Reflection (âˆ r):</u> The angle between the reflected ray and the normal.\n\nThe Two Laws of Reflection are:\n- 1. First Law: The angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection. (<u>âˆ i = âˆ r</u>)\n- 2. Second Law: The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.\n\nSolved Numerical Example:\nProblem: A ray of light makes an angle of 35Â° with a plane mirror. What is the angle of reflection?\nSolution:\n=> The given angle is with the mirror surface, not the normal. The angle of the normal to the surface is 90Â°.\n=> Angle of Incidence (âˆ i) = 90Â° - (angle with the surface)\n=> âˆ i = 90Â° - 35Â° = 55Â°.\n=> According to the First Law of Reflection, Angle of Reflection (âˆ r) = Angle of Incidence (âˆ i).\n=> <u>âˆ r = 55Â°</u>.\n\nAnalytical Insight:\nDiffuse vs. Specular Reflection: These laws apply perfectly to smooth surfaces like mirrors (specular reflection). On rough surfaces (like paper), light rays hit at many different angles, causing them to reflect in all directions (diffuse reflection). This is why you can't see your reflection in a wall!",

            explanation: "Concave Mirrors:\n- These mirrors curve inward, like a cave. They are <u>'converging' mirrors</u> because they bring parallel rays of light to a single point called the <u>focus (F)</u>.\n- Used in: Shaving mirrors (magnified image), car headlights (to produce a parallel beam), solar cookers (to focus sunlight).\n- Image type depends on object position, for example, if the object is between F and Pole (P), the image is <u>Virtual, erect, and magnified.</u>\n\nConvex Mirrors:\n- These mirrors curve outward. They are <u>'diverging' mirrors</u> because they spread out parallel rays of light so they appear to come from a focus behind the mirror.\n- Used in: Rear-view mirrors in vehicles (wide field of view), security mirrors in shops.\n- Image type is always the same: <u>Virtual, erect, and diminished (smaller)</u>, regardless of object position.\n\nThe Mirror Formula & Magnification:\n- Formula: <u>1/f = 1/v + 1/u</u>\n- Where: `f` = focal length, `v` = image distance, `u` = object distance.\n- Magnification (m): <u>m = -v/u</u>\n- If `m` is negative, the image is <u>real and inverted</u>.\n- If `m` is positive, the image is <u>virtual and erect</u>.\n\nSolved Numerical Example:\nProblem: An object is placed 10 cm in front of a concave mirror of focal length 15 cm. Find the position, nature, and magnification of the image.\nSolution (using Sign Convention):\n=> Object distance <u>u = -10 cm</u> (always negative).\n=> Focal length <u>f = -15 cm</u> (concave).\n=> Using mirror formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u\n=> 1/(-15) = 1/v + 1/(-10)\n=> 1/v = 1/10 - 1/15\n=> 1/v = (3-2)/30 = 1/30\n=> <u>v = +30 cm</u>. Since `v` is positive, the image is formed behind the mirror.\n=> Magnification <u>m = -v/u</u> = -(+30)/(-10) = +3.\n=> Result: The image is <u>virtual</u> (positive `v`), <u>erect</u> (positive `m`), and <u>magnified 3 times</u> (`m` > 1).",

This means the object was magnified:", options: ["2 times", "0.5 times", "4 times", "1 time"], correctAnswer: "2 times", explanation: "Magnification is the ratio of image height to object height. A value of -2 means the image is inverted and twice the size of the object. The magnitude of magnification is 2." },
      { conceptTitle: "Total Internal Reflection", question: "The sparkle of a diamond is due to:", options: ["Its hardness", "Its high refractive index leading to TIR", "Its cutting", "Its reflection properties"], correctAnswer: "Its high refractive index leading to TIR", explanation: "Diamond has a very high refractive index, resulting in a small critical angle. Light entering the diamond undergoes multiple total internal reflections before it exits, creating the sparkling effect." },
      { conceptTitle: "Spherical Mirrors", question: "The focus of a convex mirror is:", options: ["In front of the mirror", "On the surface of the mirror", "Behind the mirror", "At infinity"], correctAnswer: "Behind the mirror", explanation: "For a convex mirror, parallel rays appear to diverge from a point behind the mirror. This point is the virtual principal focus." },
      { conceptTitle: "Assertion-Reason", question: "Assertion (A): The mirror formula can be applied to a plane mirror. Reason (R): A plane mirror is a spherical mirror of infinite focal length.", options: ["Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A", "Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A", "A is true but R is false", "A is false but R is true"], correctAnswer: "Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A", explanation: "A plane mirror can be considered a spherical mirror with an infinite radius of curvature, and thus an infinite focal length. If f=âˆž, 1/f=0. Mirror formula becomes 1/v + 1/u = 0, or v = -u, which is correct for a plane mirror." }
