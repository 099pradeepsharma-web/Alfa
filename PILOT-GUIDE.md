# ðŸš€ PILOT DEPLOYMENT & TESTING GUIDE

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Do This Now)

### 1. UPDATE YOUR ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION

**CRITICAL FIX**: Update your `.env.local` file with the new variable names:

```env
# OLD (causing errors):
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# NEW (correct format):
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

**Complete .env.local setup:**
```env
# Copy this exactly into your .env.local file:
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
NODE_ENV=development
VITE_APP_NAME=Alfanumrik
VITE_APP_VERSION=0.1.0
VITE_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_MONITOR=true
VITE_ENABLE_API_CACHE=true
VITE_PILOT_MODE=true
VITE_PILOT_FEEDBACK_EMAIL=099pradeepsharma@gmail.com
```

### 2. PULL THE LATEST CHANGES

```bash
# In your local Alfa directory:
git fetch origin
git checkout feature/pilot-ready-performance
npm install  # Install any new dependencies
npm run dev  # Start with new optimizations
```

### 3. VERIFY THE FIXES WORK

1. **Open http://localhost:3000**
2. **Check for errors** in browser console (F12)
3. **Test AI features** - try generating a quiz or starting tutor chat
4. **Monitor performance** - should feel faster with skeleton loading

## PILOT DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Option 1: Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from your project directory
vercel

# Follow prompts:
# - Link to existing project: No
# - Project name: alfanumrik-pilot
# - Environment: Add VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY
```

### Option 2: Netlify Deployment

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Upload 'dist' folder to Netlify
# Or connect GitHub repository for auto-deployment
```

### Environment Variables for Production:
```env
# Add these to your deployment platform:
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_APP_NAME=Alfanumrik
VITE_PILOT_MODE=true
VITE_ENABLE_API_CACHE=true
VITE_PILOT_FEEDBACK_EMAIL=your_email@domain.com
```

## PILOT TESTING PLAN

### Week 1: Internal Testing
- **You + 2-3 close contacts** test all features
- **Focus**: Find breaking bugs, UX issues
- **Document**: Create bug list and prioritize fixes

### Week 2: Limited Beta
- **5-10 students from different grades** (8th, 9th, 10th)
- **2-3 teachers** to test monitoring features
- **1-2 parents** to test parent dashboard
- **Focus**: Real usage patterns, content quality

### Week 3: School Pilot
- **1 school with 20-30 students**
- **3-5 teachers actively monitoring**
- **Focus**: Scalability, teacher adoption, learning outcomes

### Success Metrics to Track:
- **Engagement**: 70%+ daily active users
- **Completion**: 60%+ lesson completion rate
- **Performance**: <5% crash/error rate
- **Satisfaction**: 4.2+ rating from students
- **Teacher Adoption**: 80%+ teachers using monitoring features

## KNOWN ISSUES & WORKAROUNDS

### Current Limitations:
1. **No cloud sync**: Data stays on local device only
   - *Workaround*: Advise users to use same device
   - *Future*: Implement Supabase backend

2. **Large initial bundle**: ~2-3MB download
   - *Mitigation*: Progressive loading and caching implemented
   - *Future*: Server-side rendering

3. **AI response variability**: Gemini responses can vary
   - *Mitigation*: Response caching and retry logic
   - *Future*: Response quality scoring

### Emergency Fixes:
```bash
# If app breaks after update:
git checkout main  # Revert to stable version
npm run dev

# If environment issues:
rm .env.local
cp .env.example .env.local
# Re-add your API key
```
